Day after day, they scoured through mounds of data trying to find that golden sales lead. Nights were spent ruminating over strategies for the perfect sales pitch. There were meetings and workshops—endless tasks that all aimed at one goal; to grow their businesses. But amidst all the odds stacked against them, life in the sales world was increasingly becoming tough.\n",
